# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a method to fit a line through all the data using certain optimizing algorithm (usually 
least squared, mean squared, etc). Linear regression will follow below formula
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ...$$
with $\beta_x$ represents the coefficient value and $x_i$ represents the parameter that will be used
for predicting the constrained parameter (Y). In practice, the value of each $\beta$ will be started from small value 
near 0 and when calculating the optimizing algorithm, each $\beta$ will be customized such that the final changed
equation of Y will cause the optimizing algorithm to be as small as possible (which represents the minimum difference
between the actual value and the predicted value).

# Motivation
Given a dataset (numerical or categorical encoded into integer), how do you fit a line through all the data such
that the distance from each data from the dataset is the minimum compared to other line configuration?

# Limitation
Best work on numerical dataset. Categorical dataset need encoding into integer and rounding of the predicted value 
to determine what category does the data belong?
