# Bias & Variance
Bias is the inability of machine learning method to capture the true relationship of each sample. Bias is
usually calculated using a distance algorithm and the value is compared with the value calculated from another 
algorithm and algorithm with the least value is usually chosen as main method.  
Variance is the difference in fits between datasets (training and test data). Variance is usually calculated by 
the same algorithm for bias or common formula for variance, but maybe differ according to implementation or 
other heuristics. 

# Motivation
Given a numerical dataset and a model to check, how good does a model fit into the training and test set?

# Limitation
Best works for numerical dataset (continuous). Need one-hot encoding for categorization task and rounding the values 
to nearest value may not be the best approach. Same for integer-valued numerical dataset.

# Algorithm
```None```

# Example
(Do later)
