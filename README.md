# Machine Learning Algorithms Analysis
This repo is used mainly for implementing machine learning algorithms and comparing algorithms implemented from scratch and 
using Python Libraries. The data used here will be stored in `data` folder and is comprised of two main dataset: bitcoin value (for numerical analysis) and tweets categorization into emotion (classification analysis). The analysis will be implemented in `src` folder
and contain the name of algorithm, which consists of a readme.md for algorithm explanation (simple algorithm and example) and analysis report and two other folder : Scratch (C++) and Complex (Python). Each folder will consist of one file that will implement the algorithm.
This repo is made in effort to ~make myself understand and a reminder in the future~ give a better understanding how these algorithm implemented and ultimately be used for a reference for those who seek knowledge or is lost in learning it. Made with love <3
